# HPE ProLiant MicroServer Gen10 & Gen10 Plus Fan Policy Proxy

[English Document](./README.enUS.md)

This project uses Arduino to proxy PWM signals to support Noctua and other low-speed silent fans for the HPE ProLiant MicroServer Gen10 & Gen10 Plus server model. It also supports using a second fan interface to cool the iLO chip.

### Chip Verification Program

To ensure you can correctly flash the fan control policy, you can use the LED test program below to verify your development environment and development board.

Detailed implementation: [arduino-test](./arduino-test.ino)

### Fan Policy Control Section

The following is sourced from [zhaoyingpu/hpe-gen10-fan-proxy](https://github.com/zhaoyingpu/hpe-gen10-fan-proxy), improved from [Max-Sum/HP-fan-proxy/blob/master/hp_fan.ino](https://github.com/Max-Sum/HP-fan-proxy/blob/master/hp_fan.ino).

The RPM converter generates corresponding RPM pulse signals (2 pulses per revolution) based on HPE's input signal. It uses delay when RPM is less than 900, otherwise uses PWM output. This function is not actually used by HPE, which only needs a pull-down signal to confirm fan presence.

The HPE fan is rated at 6100 RPM, while the Noctua NF-A8 PWM runs at 2200 RPM, with 1/3 airflow (55.5 vs 146.88 mÂ³/h) and 1/10 static pressure (2.37 vs 22.8 mm H2O). Therefore, I mapped the duty cycle from 0.1-0.2 to 0.5-1.0. The minimum duty cycle is 0.5.
